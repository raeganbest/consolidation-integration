"The time is now, on an evening very much like the one we have just witnessed. 
Tonight's story on The Twilight Zone is somewhat unique and calls for a different kind of introduction. 
This, as you may recognize, is a maintenance service elevator, still in operation, waiting for you. We invite you, if you dare, to step aboard because in tonight's episode you are the star.
And this elevator travels directly to . . . The Twilight Zone." 



"You are the passengers on a most uncommon elevator about to take the strangest journey of their lives. Your number has in your name for an extended stay.
You are about to discover what lies beyond the fifth dimension, beyond the deepest, darkest corner of the imagination . . . in the Tower of Terror." 



"A warm welcome back to those of you who made it, and a friendly word of warning, something you won't find in any guidebook: 
the next time you check into a deserted hotel on the dark side of Hollywood, make sure you know just what kind of vacancy you're filling, 
or you may find yourself a permanent resident . . . of The Twilight Zone."
